## WEATHER FORECAST
for this challenge we were tasked with making a website that will forecast the weather for 5 days in any city. When we first get the the page we should be greeted with a blank page that has a header and a search bar. when you search a city the next five days of weather should show up on the page. The weather should include the temperature, wind speed and humidity. the current day will be larger that the next four days. The past cities you search should be visible below the search bar. I had a bit of trouble with this one and honestly just wanted to upload something so I do not have two missing assignemnts.
